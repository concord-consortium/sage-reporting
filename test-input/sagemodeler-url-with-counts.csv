This describes the process in which the tanker is crushed or the volume is decreased. When simulated the model accurately represents the relationships and changes in the variables.,"Some key relationships are the relationship between the temperature inside the tanker and the pressure inside the tanker. This relationship is important because without the increase in temperature, there would not be an increase in pressure which without this the tanker would not have been crushed. 
Another key relationship is the relationship between the atmospheric air pressure and the volume of the tanker. This is important because as the air pressure increases the volume is constant until the pressure overcomes the structure of the tanker. This then cause the rapid increase in volume of the tanker.","We specified the relationships the way we did because the pressure in the model wants to be equal. So if the pressure is higher in one area than in another, then the high pressure will want to go to the lower pressure area to equalize. this is known because in the model when the pressure on the inside of the tanker is low, the higher pressure in the atmosphere wants to get inside the tanker to even out. so the atmospheric pressure is pushing down on the tanker which causes a collapse of the tanker. These relationships rely on the equalization of pressure due to changes in temperature.",I am uncertain about how humidity would affect any of the variables or if it even would at all. ,https://learn-report.concord.org/dataservice/blobs/901779/f70ca050e51211e9a72c0242ac110002.blob,,https://learn-report.concord.org/dataservice/blobs/901787/1ec9ba88e51311e9a72c0242ac110002.blob,,This affects the position of the balloon skin because if there are more atoms on the inside there will be more collisions with the inner part of the balloon skin which will cause the skin to move toward the outside more. If there were more atoms on the outside there would be more collisions on the outer skin of the balloon which would cause the skin to move further inward.,If the atoms inside of the balloon were hotter than they would move faster which would result in more more collisions on the inner surface. This is another way to increase the amount of collisions without increasing the number of atoms.,"People's ears pop on airplanes because the speed at which the plane is going is higher than the pressure can catch up to, resulting in the pressure building in your ears the higher you go. And when the pressure finally catches up your ears will un-pop.","The deeper you go the more water is weighing on your head so there is more pressure. When you dive in, your head is adjusted to the low pressure environment above the water so when it is introduced to higher pressure it hurts.",Graph 1,"As the volume increases, the molecules get more and more spread out. This decreases the amount of collisions because the molecules are farther apart. this is return decreases the pressure because the molecules are less concentrated in one area.","As the volume is increased, the pressure is decreased at a decreasing rate of change. This is because as there is more volume there is more room for the molecules to move so they aren't as compressed causing low pressure.",https://sagemodeler.concord.org/app/?launchFromLara=eyJyZWNvcmRpZCI6MTE4NDAyLCJhY2Nlc3NLZXlzIjp7InJlYWRPbmx5IjoiN2Y1MjdkNjUxNDExYTE5MTJmMzMwNjMxMjZmZGFmYzRiMThkN2ZhZSJ9fQ,We learned more about the concepts and what to add.,We could make our model more organized. ,https://sagemodeler.concord.org/app/?launchFromLara=eyJyZWNvcmRpZCI6MTE4NTEwLCJhY2Nlc3NLZXlzIjp7InJlYWRPbmx5IjoiZDExNzg1N2Y2MGMwYjgyMzBjZTUzMmFiMTg2MGIxODk3M2QxMDEzYSJ9fQ,"Because the hotter it is the more tire pressure there would be in the tire.

This is because the particles inside the tire move slower and so there would be less collisions with this inside of the tire causing the tire pressure to decrease.,"In the past, the science of hot air balloons has led us to great discoveries about gas laws.
