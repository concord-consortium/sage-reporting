For 40 atoms it took 7.8 ps to get to 90% completion.","When the amount of reactants is higher the more the atoms bump into each other, so they are colliding more frequently. ","When the temperature was all the way down it took 134.7ps to get to 80% completion.

As the temperature in the system increases, the rate of change of the absorbance of the system increases as well. Similarly, the concentration of bleach in the system impacts the rate of change of absorbance by more and more. If our graph was based on the concentration of dye, the rate of change would decrease in relation to the increase of temperature or amount of bleach. ","Since absorbance is the opposite of transmittance, it can be concluded that by increasing the temperature in a system, transmittance in the system will decrease. Additionally, increasing the concentration of bleach in the system will also decrease the transmittance in the system. ","The concentration of bleach in the system directly increases the absorbance of the system, meaning that when the concentration of bleach in increased, absorbance increases as well. This relationship was expected because the ability of bleach to make things clear was already observed. ","The models record the absorbance at 0, while our data did not have a recorded data point at 0 seconds. When the temperature was 90 degrees, the absorbance of the dye decreased so quickly that the decrease was not shown in the graph. Since the decrease happened in the reaction but could not be shown in the graph, the trend lines were skewed.
