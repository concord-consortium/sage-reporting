The tanker was leaking air so the pressure on the inside was decreasing. The pressure on the outside of the tanker was increasing because it was getting hotter out and heat makes air expand. Because there was so much pressure on the outside and not enough on the inside the tanker ended up caving in on itself.,"Your ears pop when you fly in an airplane due to air pressure.

So, like the main idea of the article, when it is cold out your tires deflate faster, and in the summer when its hot they expand faster.

2. Hair spray bottle. Shrinks when its cold and expands when it is hot.

3. Coke bottle. Shrinks when its cold and expands when it is hot. ","We never knew that when its colder out tires lose air pressure faster. We have all been taught gas laws in pass science classes we just have never made the connection with tires. ",How much air pressure in your tires is too much air pressure for the winter?,"We think it would be cool to read more articles that involve this law, for example an experimental article that talks about at what temperature does a hair spray bottle explode. ","B-Tag is a program that tells you real time tire performance and statistics. It makes making decisions easy and fast. It is a sensor that records tire pressure and temperature to let you know what is safe and what is not. ","Because in the mining industry they are using so many vehicles and machines used on a daily bases, not only does it insure the safety of the works but it makes annual checks faster and easier. It also prolongs tire use and increase productivity. ","It would be highly helpful for ice road truckers, because of the constant frigid conditions, the tire pressure drops faster then in normal conditions. With this device, the truckers would know exactly when to add air pressure which would also increase safety and productivity. ","It would also be highly helpful for truckers constantly changing conditions. With warm weather expanding the tire and cold weather shrinking it without this device it would be highly complicated to constantly check your tires to make sure they are good for the weather conditions. ","Our experiment was designed to show the relationship between pressure and temperature. In our experiment we heated up a coke can to see how much the can would explain before exploding. Once recording this data we put the coke can in freezing conditions (ice water) to see how much the can would shrink. With this the relationship was clear that when temperature increased pressure increased (the can exploding) and when the temperature decreased the pressure decreased ( did not explode).

3. Coke bottle. Shrinks when its cold and expands when it is hot. ","We never knew that when its colder out tires lose air pressure faster.

It is a sensor that records tire pressure and temperature to let you know what is safe and what is not.

It also prolongs tire use and increase productivity. ","It would be highly helpful for ice road truckers, because of the constant frigid conditions, the tire pressure drops faster then in normal conditions. With this device, the truckers would know exactly when to add air pressure which would also increase safety and productivity. ","It would also be highly helpful for truckers constantly changing conditions. With warm weather expanding the tire and cold weather shrinking it without this device it would be highly complicated to constantly check your tires to make sure they are good for the weather conditions. ","Our experiment was designed to show the relationship between pressure and temperature. In our experiment we heated up a coke can to see how much the can would explain before exploding. Once recording this data we put the coke can in freezing conditions (ice water) to see how much the can would shrink.

Some water was inside the tanker, and then the temperature change from the hot water inside to the cold water added to the outside lead the tanker to compress. ","What Raquel and I did on the process of recreating the phenomenon is we filled a can of soda up with water, and put it on a metal plate to heat it up. After once we saw the water started to boil, we added it in the cold ice bath. Once we did that, then it would brush. ","We used a hot plate, goggles, cold ice bath, and the soda. We used all of these to recreate the actual tank, and then goggles for safety. The soda can acted like the tank, and the hot plate heated it up. ","Yes we did because we weren't fast enough in putting the soda can into the ice bath water. Due to this, the soda can never crushed. We had to move faster to the ice bath from the hot plate. ","Yes it was. This is because we did the exact same steps as what the people did. We made sure that the soda can was filled with water, and then we made sure that once the can and the water became hot, that the soda can was put into the ice water upside down. It did exactly what the large tanker did. ","What I would have done differently is add a lot more ice. Every time I would let go of the soda can, the can wouldn't stay, and the can would fall and the outside air molecules would go inside the can, instead of the cold molecules from the ice bath.

As the steam from the water cooled down, it turned into a liquid. The volume of the tanker before was greater then the outside temperature because of the steam inside. The pressure started to go down once the steam turned into liquid, and the outside temperature began to cool down the tanker and the outside became the higher temperature. The pressure on the outside also began to become larger then the inside. Once that occurred, the kinetic energy inside the tanker started to slow down rapidly and the kinetic energy on the outside started to become faster then the inside. The outside began to push the inside and the tanker eventually compressed.
