This describes the process in which the tanker is crushed or the volume is decreased. When simulated the model accurately represents the relationships and changes in the variables.,"Some key relationships are the relationship between the temperature inside the tanker and the pressure inside the tanker. This relationship is important because without the increase in temperature, there would not be an increase in pressure which without this the tanker would not have been crushed. 
Another key relationship is the relationship between the atmospheric air pressure and the volume of the tanker. This is important because as the air pressure increases the volume is constant until the pressure overcomes the structure of the tanker. This then cause the rapid increase in volume of the tanker.","We specified the relationships the way we did because the pressure in the model wants to be equal. So if the pressure is higher in one area than in another, then the high pressure will want to go to the lower pressure area to equalize. this is known because in the model when the pressure on the inside of the tanker is low, the higher pressure in the atmosphere wants to get inside the tanker to even out. so the atmospheric pressure is pushing down on the tanker which causes a collapse of the tanker. These relationships rely on the equalization of pressure due to changes in temperature.","I am uncertain about how humidity would affect any of the variables or if it even would at all. ",https://learn-report.concord.org/dataservice/blobs/901779/f70ca050e51211e9a72c0242ac110002.blob,,https://learn-report.concord.org/dataservice/blobs/901787/1ec9ba88e51311e9a72c0242ac110002.blob,,This affects the position of the balloon skin because if there are more atoms on the inside there will be more collisions with the inner part of the balloon skin which will cause the skin to move toward the outside more. If there were more atoms on the outside there would be more collisions on the outer skin of the balloon which would cause the skin to move further inward.,If the atoms inside of the balloon were hotter than they would move faster which would result in more more collisions on the inner surface. This is another way to increase the amount of collisions without increasing the number of atoms.,"People's ears pop on airplanes because the speed at which the plane is going is higher than the pressure can catch up to, resulting in the pressure building in your ears the higher you go. And when the pressure finally catches up your ears will un-pop.","The deeper you go the more water is weighing on your head so there is more pressure.

The pressure inside the car as it relates to the volume of the tanker car. The volume will stay level, until the pressure is too little. Then volume will drop, before leveling out again.

As the temperature decreases, so will the pressure.","These relationships rely on equalizing pressure between the outside and the inside of the tanker car. As the temperature inside the tanker car decreases, then the pressure inside will too, and because the pressure wants to equalize, the high pressure will want to go to the area of low pressure. So if the outside air pressure is higher, it will attempt to push the walls of the tanker care in. as the air pressure on the inside decreases, it will try to pull in the walls of the tanker car.

The pressure inside the car as it relates to the volume of the tanker car. The volume will stay level, until the pressure is too little. Then volume will drop, before leveling out again.
2. the atmospheric air pressure as it relates to the volume of the car. As the air pressure increases, the volume of the tanker car stays consistent until the pressure is too much, then drops dramatically, before leveling out again.
3. The temperature relating to pressure. As the temperature increases, so will the pressure. As the temperature decreases, so will the pressure.","These relationships rely on equalizing pressure between the outside and the inside of the tanker car. As the temperature inside the tanker car decreases, then the pressure inside will too, and because the pressure wants to equalize, the high pressure will want to go to the area of low pressure. So if the outside air pressure is higher, it will attempt to push the walls of the tanker care in. as the air pressure on the inside decreases, it will try to pull in the walls of the tanker car. Eventually, the pressure outside and the pulling inside will too much, and the walls of the car won't be able to hold, and will implode, decreasing the volume.","One problem with our model is that it shows the inside pressure increasing, and while we can talk about the inverse, we don't know how to correctly represent that the pressure is decreasing inside the tanker car.",https://learn-report.concord.org/dataservice/blobs/901882/fb77747ae51311e9a72c0242ac110002.blob,,https://learn-report.concord.org/dataservice/blobs/909728/919706cae69d11e9a8e70242ac110003.blob,,"The more atoms on the inside, the more they hit the membrane of the balloon, moving the membrane outward.

This describes the process in which the tanker is crushed or the volume is decreased. When simulated the model accurately represents the relationships and changes in the variables.,"Some key relationships are the relationship between the temperature inside the tanker and the pressure inside the tanker. This relationship is important because without the increase in temperature, there would not be an increase in pressure which without this the tanker would not have been crushed. 
Another key relationship is the relationship between the atmospheric air pressure and the volume of the tanker. This is important because as the air pressure increases the volume is constant until the pressure overcomes the structure of the tanker. This then cause the rapid increase in volume of the tanker.","We specified the relationships the way we did because the pressure in the model wants to be equal. So if the pressure is higher in one area than in another, then the high pressure will want to go to the lower pressure area to equalize. this is known because in the model when the pressure on the inside of the tanker is low, the higher pressure in the atmosphere wants to get inside the tanker to even out. so the atmospheric pressure is pushing down on the tanker which causes a collapse of the tanker. These relationships rely on the equalization of pressure due to changes in temperature.","I am uncertain about how humidity would affect any of the variables or if it even would at all.

If there were more atoms on the outside there would be more collisions on the outer skin of the balloon which would cause the skin to move further inward.,If the atoms inside of the balloon were hotter than they would move faster which would result in more more collisions on the inner surface. This is another way to increase the amount of collisions without increasing the number of atoms.,"People's ears pop on airplanes because the speed at which the plane is going is higher than the pressure can catch up to, resulting in the pressure building in your ears the higher you go. And when the pressure finally catches up your ears will un-pop.","The deeper you go the more water is weighing on your head so there is more pressure. When you dive in, your head is adjusted to the low pressure environment above the water so when it is introduced to higher pressure it hurts.",Graph 1,"As the volume increases, the molecules get more and more spread out.

It gives you a basic idea of how the tanker exploded without the extra fluff.
